# Architecture
- Software architecture is the **fundamental organization of a software system**
- Blueprint that defines the system's high-level structure
- Encompasses system's components, the relationships among them, and the principles guiding its design and evolution
- Key characteristics i.e. the ones architecture is concerned about: scalability, maintainability, reliability, availability, security, performance, testability, extensibility

# Design
- The process of conceptualizing and planning how a software system will work to satisfy its requirements
- Focuses on how the system's components, modules, functions, algorithms, and data structures will be implemented
- Detailed planning stage before the coding begins

# Architecture (A) vs Design (D)
- Analogy:
    - A: architectural plan for a city; deals with the **what** are the major parts and **why** are they structures this way
    - D: detailed blueprints for an individual building; deals with the **how** are we building the individual parts
- Focus:
    - A: high-level structure, components and their relationships; high-level design (HLD)
    - D: detailed implementation, internal workings of individual modules, components, classes, and algorithms; low-level design (LLD)
- Concerns:
    - A: **non-functional requirements** like scalability, availability, security, performance, maintainability
    - D: algorithms, data structures, component interactions, functions, and interfaces
- Patterns:
    - A: **Architectural Patterns** e.g. microservices, monolithic, event-driven, service-oriented
    - D: **Design Patterns** e.g. Factory, Singleton, Observer
- Change impact:
    - A: decisions are costly and difficult ti change once implemented as they form the system's foundation
    - D: decisions are easier to change later as they are localized

# Agentic AI
- Agentic AI is a concept.
- The key concept here is Agentic - from the concept of "agency", which can be thought of as "autonomy".
- Autonomy in decision making, planning, and taking action.
- Properties of Agentic AI systems:
    - **Autonomy**: operate independently
    - **Goal oriented**: work toward predefined goals
    - **Perceive**: gather data from multiple sources, such as sensors, databases, and digital interfaces
    - **Reason**: LLMs as reasoning engines
    - **Act**: task execution by means of tools integration
    - **Learn**: continuous improvement through feedback loop, or "data flywheel", where data generated from its interactions is fed into the systems to enhance models

# AI Agent
- AI Agent is an autonomous, goal-oriented system or application.
- It can be said to be an implementation of the Agentic AI concept.

# Process Automation
- PA is the use of software and technology to automate repetitive, manual tasks and entire functions within a **business process**
- aims to reduce human intervention, increase efficiency, and minimize errors across formalized, rule-based workflows

## Digital Process Automation
- Focuses on **transforming** and automating **end-to-end business processes**

## Task Automation
- automates a single, simple, repetitive activity
- uses simple tools, scripts, or macros
- e.g. auto-replying to a specific email type

## Robotic Process Automation
- focused on user interface
- automates tasks by mimicking human actions on a computer screen
- replicate human interactions for high-volume, repetitive work
- uses software robots (bots)
- e.g. a bot logging into a system and copying data from a spreadsheet
