# Learning Machine Learning
It has been sitting on my TODO list for a long time now.
And now the time has come to dive fully into it.

I am going to record my journey of learning Machine Learning.

# Bootstrapping
**Where do I start?**

This is a big question, actually. There are so many resources that it is difficult to choose.

I have chosen to follow the course structure prescribed by: [Elite Data Science](https://elitedatascience.com/learn-machine-learning)

This guide recommends learning below items first as prerequisites:

1. Python for Data Science
2. Statistics for Data Science
3. Math for Data Science

## Python for Data Science
I know the basics of Python. I aim to pick up more of it while learning Machine Learning topics instead of following this sub-course.

Having said that, I would dive into the rest two as those are completely new for me.

## Statistics for Data Science
Referring to the guide [How to Learn Statistics for Data Science](https://elitedatascience.com/learn-statistics-for-data-science), I am starting with the ThinkStats book recommended.


## Math for Data Science
