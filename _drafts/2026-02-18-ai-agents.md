# Introduction
- What are AI Agents?
- What are agentic workflows?
- How do you design agentic workflows?
- How do you develop AI Agents?

These are some of the questions that pop into my head as I hear more about AI Agents and Agentic AI.

## AI Agents
I have a fair idea of what AI Agents are - they are software applications capable of making their own decisions.
Making their own decisions is the key here. You could later segregate the decision making into planning, executing, learning, and adapting or evovling.
They need an LLM at their core for coming up with the tasks mentioned above.
The LLM is responsible for the generation part - Generative AI or GenAI.
